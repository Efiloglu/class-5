My name is Nelson Najarro, I’m from to El Salvador. I’m motivated learn every day a new thing, I like read about IT trends. 
Being on top with my studies has been a big part of my life. I consider coding like an art and programmers (coders) are artists.
I enjoy my free time reading a good book, watching Netflix series (most of the time Spain series or documentals about tecnlogy and 
history). I'm dog lovers, I think that the dogs are very smart animals due that my favorite quote is  <mark>"Life is better with a  Schnauzer"</mark>.
